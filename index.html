					<h2>The Higher the Monkey Climb.....</h2>
					<h4>September 4,2020 by Shenor</h4>
					<p>
						The popular notion is that the more an unsuitable person get promoted the more his/her inadequacies shows.
						I now see that this is a one sided view of the monkey and that view is the monkeys backside, therefore the monkey is now in a better position to (let's behave right here) on you.
						The other view is that the Monkey now has a better view of the world and can now appreciate it more.

					<h2>The Nail that Sticks Out.</h2>
					<h4>October 4,2020 by Shenor</h4>
					<p>
						One cannot simple do less then or mediocre and expect to be noticed. If you truly want to get ahead in life or in the work place doing what you are suppose to is indeed not enough.
						You have to show value, you have to show that you can handle more that you are given in order to be given more to handle.
